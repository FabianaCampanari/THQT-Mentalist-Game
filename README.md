[Thoth]() has not only been compared to [Hermes](). In fact, the Hermes referred to in [Hermeticism]() has been compared to important figures (Masters) from various cultures. Thus, the deeds of Thoth are attributed to different names of deities and sacred beings from different civilizations. In [Egyptian]() civilization, he was [Thoth](); in [Greek](), [Hermes](); in [Roman](), [Mercury](); in the [Mayan]() culture, [Quetzalcoatl](); and in [ATLANTIS](), he was [***Chiquitet Arelich Vomalich*** - The Anunak Geneticist Beside Enki](). The Sumerians and other peoples of ancient Mesopotamia also worshiped lunar deities that were virtually identical to Thoth.
