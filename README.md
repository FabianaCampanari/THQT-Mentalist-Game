Here is the English translation:

#

Thoth has not only been compared to Hermes. In fact, the Hermes referred to in Hermeticism has been compared to important figures (Masters) from various cultures. Thus, the deeds of Thoth are attributed to different names of deities and sacred beings from different civilizations. In Egyptian civilization, he was Thoth; in Greek, Hermes; in Roman, Mercury; in the Mayan culture, Quetzalcoatl; and in ATLANTIS, he was Chiquitet Arelich Vomalich. The Sumerians and other peoples of ancient Mesopotamia also worshiped lunar deities that were virtually identical to Thoth.

Let me know if you’d like it in a more formal, poetic, or academic tone.
